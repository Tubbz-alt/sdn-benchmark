			<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<p>If you haven't already done so, please read the <a href="LICENSE.html" title="End-User License">EULA</a>.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>This distribution includes</p>

<ul>
<li>A pre-built SEFloodlight runtime,</li>
<li>An audit subsystem,</li>
<li>An OpenFlow NorthboundAPI, and</li>
<li>Associated documentation, utilities, and development components.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pre-Configuration</h2>

<p>We highly recommend that you configure your OpenFlow switch to run
in secure mode (cf., running as a "dumb" switch when disconnected
from an OpenFlow controller).</p>

<p>For example, for Open vSwitch,</p>

<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; ovs-vsctl set-fail-mode </code><em>bridge</em><code> secure</code></p>

<p>configures the switch to not set up flows on its own when the controller
connection fails.</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<p>The following will start the SEFloodlight controller:</p>

<pre><code>    cd runtime
    java -jar SEFloodlight.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, for *nix-based systems, you can enter</p>

<pre><code>    cd runtime
    ./sefloodlight.sh
</code></pre>

<h2>SEFloodlight Overview</h2>

<ul>
<li>This is an enhanced version of the Floodlight OpenFlow controller that
<a href="doc/config/SEFloodlight/index.html" title="SEFloodlight">provides and enforces privilege-based OpenFlow operations</a>.</li>
<li>SEFloodlight allows capture of controller <a href="doc/config/AuditDaemon/index.html" title="OpenFlow Audit Events">OpenFlow audit events</a>
for real-time or batch processing.</li>
<li>This controller also integrates <a href="doc/config/SENorthboundAPI/NorthboundAPI.html" title="OpenFlow Northbound API">SRI's OpenFlow Northbound API floodlight module</a> (which communicates with external applications via Google Protocol Buffers
messages). This API provides complete access to both asynchronous and synchronous
OpenFlow controller-to-switch messages, and also provides additional convenience methods.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<p>This release of SEFloodlight</p>

<ul>
<li>Replaces the Alias-set Rule Reduction (ARR) algorithm with the more
comprehensive and efficient Rule-chain Conflict Analysis (RCA)
algorithm (see the NDSS 2015 paper, "Securing the Software-Defined
Network Control Layer", "IV. DESIGN OF A SECURE CONTROL MEDIATION
LAYER").</li>
<li>Implements flow-rule mediation among multiple OpenFlow switches using
a <a href="doc/config/SEFloodlight/Interconnections.html" title="Interconnected OpenFlow Switches">JSON interconnection description file</a> (caveat emptor: this
feature has not been well tested).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sponsors and Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Defense Advanced Research
Project (DARPA) Contract No. FA8750-11-C-0249 and the Army Research
Office under the Cyber-TA Research Grant (No. W911NF-06-1-0316). Thank
